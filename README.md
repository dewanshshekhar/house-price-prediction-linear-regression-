# house-price-prediction-linear-regression-
This repository showcases the implementation of a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. Developed as part of my internship at Skillcraft Technology, this project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios.
